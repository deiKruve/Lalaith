--  The file declares the main procedure for the demonstration.

--pragma Restrictions (Max_tasks => 1);

with Finrod.Nmt;               --pragma Unreferenced (Finrod.Nmt);
--  The Driver package that contains the task that actually controls the app so
--  although it is not referenced directly in the main procedure, we need it
--  in the closure of the context clauses so that it will be included in the
--  executable.

--with Last_Chance_Handler;  pragma Unreferenced (Last_Chance_Handler);
--  The "last chance handler" is the user-defined routine that is called when
--  an exception is propagated. We need it in the executable, therefore it
--  must be somewhere in the closure of the context clauses.

with Sample_App;  pragma Unreferenced (Sample_App);
-- this is the name of the custom application
-- it will set some uplinks to Finrod.Nmt so nmt can execute it.
-- it is unreferenced here, but it must be included for the uplinks to be set 
-- at elaboration time.

procedure Demo is
   --pragma Priority (System.Priority'First);

begin
   Finrod.Nmt.Fsm;
   --  loop
   --     null;
   --  end loop;
end Demo;
